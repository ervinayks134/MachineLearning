# Tutorial Overview
This tutorial is structured into multiple sections, each focusing on a key area of machine learning. Below is a brief description of what you will learn in each part:

**Introduction to Machine Learning**
In this section, you’ll get a high-level overview of what machine learning is, including the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We will also cover key terminology like features, labels, training data, and test data.

**Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is a crucial step before building any machine learning model. You’ll learn how to:
Clean the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates
Convert categorical features into numerical values
Normalize/scale the data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Building and Training Models
This section covers the process of selecting and training a machine learning model. You will:

Understand the difference between classification and regression problems
Learn how to use popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Train and fine-tune the models using scikit-learn
Evaluation Metrics
Learn how to evaluate the performance of your models using various metrics, including:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for classification
Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
Cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well
Deploying the Model
In this section, you’ll learn how to take your trained model and deploy it in a real-world application. We’ll briefly cover:

Saving and loading models using joblib or pickle
Using your model to make predictions on new data
A basic example of how to create a simple API to interact with your model using Flask
